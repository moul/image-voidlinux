Void Linux image on Scaleway [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-voidlinux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-voidlinux)
==============================

Scripts to build the official Voidlinux image on Scaleway

This image is built using [Image Tools](https://github.com/scaleway/image-tools) and depends on the [armbuild/voidlinux](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/armbuild/voidlinux/) Docker image.

**This image is meant to be used on a C1 server.**

We use the Docker's building system and convert it at the end to a disk image that will boot on real servers without Docker. Note that the image is still runnable as a Docker container for debug or for inheritance.
